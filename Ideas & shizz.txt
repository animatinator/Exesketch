-Modify "has mouse hit an object if not pass to screen" to use the new foundTarget bool in the
Event object?  AT LEAST PARTIALLY DONE (I think it might be done, actually...)
-Make it so middle-click is *always* send to the screen for zooming; objects probably don't need
this event ;)   DONE
-Include a 'modifier key' variable in the Event class   DONE
-Get rid of the bloody 'modifiers' global variable - local copies for each function? (Would't make
much of a difference...)   DONE
-ALT-MIDDLE = pan, left-click - select, left-click & drag = multi-select?

-Arbitrary polygons   IN PROGRESS
-Bezier curves
-Regular polygons
-Circles
-Rounded rect?
