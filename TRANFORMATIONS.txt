-Object class holds scale, rotation
-Object class holds isScaling, isRotating
-Object class has functions SetScale(), SetRotation()
-Transformation class function SetTransformMatrix()
and UnsetTransformMatrix() called before and after drawing
an object, with Object ref/pointer as argument.
-Transform::SetTransformMatrix(const Object* object)
{
	glPushMatrix();
	Set scale and rotation to object->GetThem();
}
-Transform::UnsetTransformMatrix()
{
	glPopMatrix();
